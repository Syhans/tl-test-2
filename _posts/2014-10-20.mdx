    Honestly, some information presented throughout this episode has to be
    incorrect, whether it is the characters' dialogue or meta information like
    the Aoi's phone or the screen text. The assumption that some deadlines got
    pushed back is the closest solution I have found. Please contact me if you
    can piece the information together in a way that is more consistent with all
    the information presented.
