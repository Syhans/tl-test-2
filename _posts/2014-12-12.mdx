Midnight as passed by now, as seen on Watanabe's phone just before he gets called by Aoi.

The screen text shows 12 days until the deadline as Aoi leaves the Mahjong place for Kanno's house. Assuming the text works the same way as has been this entire time, that puts the current date at the night from the 11th to the 12th.

While speaking with Kanno, Aoi indirectly reveals her birth year: she was 2 when Ava first aired in 1995. So she was born in 1993. This is one of the main hints [towards the year that Shirobako plays in](/calendar/general-timeframe).

The next work day begins with another meeting. Aoi reveals she has animator meetings at 11:00. Again, this ends up not being relevant.

Watanabe requests a main staff meeting right away, but Kinoshita is not available before 19:00.

At the meeting, Aoi says that she met Kanno yesterday (as in previous work day).

Aoi visits Sugie's home after the meeting ends, then both she and Sugie return to the office. It is not clear whether midnight has passed by the time the key animators hold their meeting.
