Segawa ends up cutting it close, as she herself states. The radio on Segawa's desk displays 12:10. Note that she is sick.

By 12:48, Aoi is eagerly awaiting Segawa's call.

With Aoi still waiting on Segawa, it is now 13:27.

Aoi also talks about the dubbing in two-and-a-half-hours, as mentioned by Tarou at the assembly.

The clock Aoi's drives past on her way to Segawa's displays ~13:35, so the clock is probably close to the Musani offices. On her way back, it displays ~14:50.

Aoi gets the ok from Madoka, then takes the keyframes to editing. There, Sakura confirms that the dubbing takes place in an hour and states that he can finish his job in 20 minutes.

Honda's watch also displays the time and date, though just the day of the month and weekday. Madoka wants to leave for dubbing but gets infored by Ochiai that the train line has stopped due to an accident. Honda asks Aoi to drive.

The schedule at R&B dubbing studio reads AR for Exodus episode 7 from 11:00 to 15:00, and dubbing for episode 3 from 16:00 - 21:00. Considering how seemingly everyone but Madoka is already present, it is probably now every close to the starting time.

The on-screen day ends here.
