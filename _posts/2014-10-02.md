The day where it all begins. The clock in Aoi's car displays 23:54, so it is probably safe to assume that Exodus airs past midnight.

> 23:54

Aoi gets her eurobeat on with Tomigaya and visits Segawa. During their chat, Aoi and Segawa briefly talk about the final animation director ups for episode 4 of Exodus being in two days.

> "It's only two days until the final AD up, huh?"

They also confirm that the first episode of Exodus airs this night.

> "The first episode is airing today, right?"

After finishing her business with Segawa, Aoi then returns to the office. Midnight has probably passed by now.
