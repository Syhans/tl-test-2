This is where episode 3 begins. During this episode, a "X days until delivery" screen text is shown at the beginning of every on-screen day.

It's not that 24 hours have passed, it is simply past midnight by now. Ogasawara states that she'll be present at 7:00 in the morning.

Aoi's phone displays 01:09 as she is going over her work for the day and Madoka also mentions it's technically morning already.

Yano mentions that episode 9's cutting is in two days (probably referring to the 17th, as both Aoi and Yano have not returned home yet).

When Aoi delivers the episode 9 cuts to Yamada, she says that the deadline for keyframe filming is tomorrow noon (again, probably meaning the same day).

Yamada asks for a wake-up call at 6:30 (once again, referring to the same day as tomorrow).

Before dozing off, Aoi mumbles that editing (for episode 4?) is the day after tomorrow (meaning the 17th).

Aoi's phone is also shown after she wakes up. It displays the 16th of October as the current date and a time of 6:00, close enough in time for Yamada's wake-up call.

Aoi delivers the keyframes to Ogasawara, who has arrived by now. The time should be around 7:00 by now. Ema actually went home for the night: her outfit has changed. Aoi and Iguchi are still wearing the same outfit.

    Note the absense of the "X days until delivery" screen text throughout the
    morning. The way the characters talk about the days shows that they consider
    the night following a work day still part of that work day. The screen text
    seems to be more literal about it, as in the next day is past midnight.

The rest of the day is mostly Aoi having a rough time. She is still wearing the same outfit by the time it gets dark again.
