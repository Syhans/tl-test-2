The company member watch the first episode of Exodus air together live and then either go home or return to their desks. Aoi, Tarou and Honda briefly chat about episode 3's rush check, which is scheduled for noon the "following" day (as in work day, midnight has passed by now).

On the next work day, Marukawa (the president) holds the morning assembly, at which he confirms that the episode aired the day before.

At the rush-check for episode 3 (so around noon), it is revealed that Tarou messed up and they have to find someone to do the keyframes for episode 3. Aoi, Tarou and Honda head to Segawa's and ask her for help. Aoi states they would need the missing keyframes by the morning after tomorrow.
