The day where it all begins. The clock in Aoi's car displays 23:54, so it is probably safe to assume that Exodus airs past midnight.

Aoi gets her eurobeat on with Tomigaya and visits Segawa. During their chat, Aoi and Segawa briefly talk about the final animation director ups for episode 4 of Exodus being in two days.

They also confirm that the first episode of Exodus airs this night.

After finishing her business with Segawa, Aoi then returns to the office. Midnight has probably passed by now.
