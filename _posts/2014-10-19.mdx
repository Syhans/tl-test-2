One day until the deadline. This day basically consists of Aoi freaking out and MusAni pulling all strings to get the episode ready in time. No other hints to the current time are given.

Shinkawa confirms with Aoi that editing for episode 4 is "tomorrow". This conflicts with what Aoi says during the previous on-screen day (should have happened on the 17th), which means MusAni probably pushed this back as far as possible.

Later, Aoi tries to leave for the episode 9 cutting, another conflict with what past-Aoi said (should also have happened on the 17th), and for the same day at that. At this point, an assumption about whether a. the screen text is wrong, or b. the appointments got pushed back, needs to be made. We'll be going with the latter, as editing and cutting getting delayed could still have been decided off-screen, especially given the crunch time circumstances at MusAni at this time.
