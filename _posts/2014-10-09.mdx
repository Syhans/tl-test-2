This date is not confirmed, but very likely. Segawa's cold has gotten worse, so it being the next day is at least plausible.

The day begins with Aoi buying dounts. The previous day has passed because her outfit changed, as did Segawa's. Also, it would have started raining rather abruptly, considering the good weather at sunset of the previous day.

After taking care of Segawa for a bit, Aoi returns to the Musani office. The sun has completely set by now. The sun sets in Tokyo at around ~17:14 on this day, so it is likely a good bit past this time.

Honda mentions episode 4's dubbing taking place in a week. Episode 3's dubbing took place on the 8th, so this is another hint to this on-screen day being very close to that date.

The day ends with Endou agreeing to tag in as the animation director for episode 4 of Exodus.
