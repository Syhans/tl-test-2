Aoi's, Midori's and Kaori's drinking session from the previous day lasts past midnight.

Back at work the following morning, Aoi's phone displays 10:10. Tarou and Yano talk about some of the upcoming schedule, though, again, these events are not shown on-screen.

The clock on Segawa's desk displays ~10:14 when Aoi calls her. Segawa is wearing a cooling pad on her forehead, but judging from the energy drink (?) on her desk and her being fine later, she is not actually sick like during episode 1 and 2. She probably pulled an all-nighter and goes to sleep off-screen before Aoi visits her later this day.

When Aoi calls her sister, it is 10:30.

Aoi speaks with Ema on the office's rooftop. After Ema leaves, Aoi receives a mail from her sister. Her phone displays 13:42.

Episode 8 begins here.

  <AlertDescription>
    Between episode 7 and 8, Aoi and Yano have changed outfits, despite it still
    being the same on-screen day. Segawa too, but she probably slept between her
    appearances (Aoi even greets her with good morning, despite it being
    midday). Tarou, Ema and Iguchi have not changed outfits. This seems to be a
    production error. Another one happens later this episode.

Aoi calls Kaori at 15:30.

It looks like she just got back from picking up key frames, probably Segawa's. This seems to be cutting it close, given the 1-hour-ish drive between the MusAni offices and her place. Especially if you assume that Aoi waited the 30 minutes for Kisa to return from his break.

No further hints towards the current time are given, other than the sun starting to set when Iguchi shows Ema her "secret spot", which can be reached in 15 minutes via bike from the MusAni offices.
