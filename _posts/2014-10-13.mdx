Honda mentions that the episode is getting done only three days before airing. Given that episode 1 of Exodus aired on the 2nd, the air date of episode 3 would be the 16th. Subtracting three days yields the current date.

A minor inconsistency in all this is that Tarou, Yano and Ochiai are all wearing the same outfit as on the previous on-screen day, so they all would have to have stayed the night. Aoi and Honda are wearing different outfits.

Aoi also states that episode 4's filming should still happen on this day.

The sun is setting by the time Aoi leaves the office and Ema calls Shizuka. They talk about if they and the rest of the girls are still meeting up this month, which Ema confirms.
