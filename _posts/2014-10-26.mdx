The day gets told from two perspectives: from Aoi's in episode 4 and Tarou's in a flashback episode 5.

### Aoi's perspective

The girls spend their day together! Most much else to say about this day from Aoi's point of view.

    Instead, let's talk drinks! Legal drinking age in Japan is 20. Considering
    the Japanese education system and that Aoi, Ema and Shizuka graduated in
    2012, Misa in 2013 and Midori in 2014, at most, Aoi, Ema and Shizuka are 21,
    Misa is 20 and Midori is 19. So it makes sense that Midori is the one to
    take the drunk Shizuka home.

It is 20:26 when Tarou calls Aoi.

Aoi actually passes the MusAni office right as Tarou calls her for the second time, which is shown again later in a flashback in episode 5.

### Tarou's perspective

Tarou gives a horrendous display of communication skills at what is basically a game of telephone between Kinoshita (the director), Shimoyanagi (the CGI team's lead) and Endou (Exodus episode 8's animation director).

    Episode 8 of Exodus is supposed to air on the night of November 20, so in
    about 3.5 weeks, with the deadline being closer to three weeks.

During this flashback, the only hint at the current time given is Tarou calling Aoi for the second time sometime past 20:26.
