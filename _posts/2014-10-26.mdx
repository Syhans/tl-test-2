The girls spend their day together! Most much else to say about this day. (Episode 5 Spoiler)

<Alert>
  <Beer />
  <AlertDescription>
    Instead, let's talk drinks! Legal drinking age in Japan is 20. Considering
    the Japanese education system and that Aoi, Ema and Shizuka graduated in
    2012, Misa in 2013 and Midori in 2014, at most, Aoi, Ema and Shizuka are 21,
    Misa is 20 and Midori is 19. So it makes sense that Midori is the one to
    take the drunk Shizuka home.

It is 20:26 when Tarou calls Aoi.

Aoi actually passes the MusAni office right as Tarou calls her for the second time.
