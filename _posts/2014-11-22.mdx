A new day, Aoi and Kinoshita have changed outfits. They and the animation supervisors Segawa, Ogasawara and Endou (?) hold meetings with the various key animators working on the final Exodus episode.

After Aoi ponders over her future again, we get a brief montage of Shizuka rehearsing for a play, Misa at work and Midori in a library...
