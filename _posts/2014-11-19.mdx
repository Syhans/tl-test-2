Misa's story arc is mostly independent of what's happening at MusAni, any events only involving her could technically have happened on any day, but again, this is shown here, so it most likely happened here.

Over on the MusAni side, Honda and Kinoshita meet with the writer Maitake to discuss rewriting the ending of Exodus episode 13.
