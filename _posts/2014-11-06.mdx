    Neat detail: Aoi only responding with "not us" to Kaori saying that anime
    studios only start working in the evening implies that evening/night work
    hours are the norm in the industry.

Aoi says that "we all have to be there by 10" for the morning assemblies, so all the assemblies that have been and will be shown probably happen at or around this time.

At said assembly for the day, Ochiai announces that he will leave the company at the end of the week. Today, the 6th, is a Friday. So, he'll be gone after the next episode.

Responsibility for Exodus episode 11 shifts from Ochiai to Yano, episode 12 from Yano to Tarou and Aoi gets episode 13, the final episode. The exchange between Ochiai and Aoi implies that he was responsible for the episode, not Tarou.

Aoi, yelling at the sleeping Kinoshita that next month is past when the final episode airs, is not quite correct here: it is scheduled to air on the night from the 25th to the 26th of December.

The current date is confirmed by Ema's calendar: today is the 6th of November.

The on-screen day ends with Aoi, Modori and Kaori eating and drinking at Aoi's place.
