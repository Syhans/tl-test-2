    The screen text reading "34 days until deadline" unfortunately does not
    check out: subtracting 34 days from the 24th of December results in the 20th
    of November. However, this day is confirmed to have passed.
    <br />
    It should read "33 days until deadline": the deadline is 100% confirmed to
    be the 24th of December, the Wednesday before the night of the 25th when
    Exodus airs.
