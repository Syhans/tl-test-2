The staff review the finished key frames, Sugie asks if he can redo one of them.

Aoi's and Uchida's (half-rim glasses key animator) outfit does not change between the review scene and when Yano arrives, so this is still the same day. Yano asks whether dubbing for the episode is tomorrow, which Aoi confirms.
