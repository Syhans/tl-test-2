Episode 4 ends on some foreshadowing: Honda grills Kinoshita about on Exodus's final episode's storyboards that was supposed to be finished "by this week".

It is Monday, and judging by what Honda says at the assembly later, "this week" probably refers to the week that has just passed.

Episode 4 ends on Endou declaring that he quits as AD for episode 8 of Exodus. The flashback in episode 5 adds the missing context of Tarou not communicating correctly (to put it mildly).

A bit into episode 5, there is another morning assembly. Honda mentions that the storyboards were supposed to be done by September 20 and that they are a month late. To be more specific, they are over five weeks late.

This is the first day in which Honda locks up Kinoshita in the storage room. This is a helpful hint for later.

It is about 11:05 when Endou arrives at his home.

Later, Endou is out eating with Hotta and Kitano. His phone displays 21:32 when he gets called by Tarou.

By the time Aoi visits Segawa, it might already be past midnight, considering she ate together with Ema at her place, then returned to the office again. Remember that Segawa seems to live a good distance away from the MusAni offices via car, as seen on [October 8](/calendar/2014-10-08).
