Episode 4 ends on some foreshadowing: Honda grills Kinoshita about on unspecified episode's storyboard that was supposed to be finished "by this week".

It is Monday, and it is not quite clear whether Honda is upset because the deadline has already passed or Kinoshita's progress is behind schedule if he's supposed to finish in a week.

Episode 4 ends on Endou declaring that he quits as AD for episode 8 of Exodus.
