The after-recording for episode 8 of Exodus takes place in the morning and dubbing for episode 4 in the afternoon.

During the dispute at the afternoon session, Aoi states that they have five more days until the deadline for episode 4.

This means that the delivery day for said episode is the 20th, a Monday, so three days before the episode airs.

The meeting regarding Exodus's main characters suggested by Aoi does not begin until after the sun has fully set.
