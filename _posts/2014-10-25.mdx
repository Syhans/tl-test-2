At the end of the previous episode the main quintet agreed to meet up on Sunday. This is the day before said Sunday.

This is the day of Shizuka's first anime audition, as confirmed by Ema.

Aoi does recall Shizuka calling her, which happened on the 9th, so more than two weeks ago (later when calling Shizuka, she refers to this as "the other day"). Ema confirms that they are meeting tomorrow.

When Aoi leaves for the day, informs Honda that she has reserved a room for a filming meeting on Monday (the 27th), 16:00.

Tarou also once again asks Aoi whether tomorrow is her day off, which she confirms. At home, Aoi gets called by her mother and receives a message from Shizuka and calls her.
