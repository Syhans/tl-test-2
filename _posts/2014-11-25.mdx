Watanabe's phone displays 2:46 as he's calling the taxi service, by the time Aoi and the director leave, it is probably past three in the morning.

The episode ends with the screen text displaying "29 days until deadline". Assuming the screen text works similar to how it did during episode 3 / the 16th/19th of November, this is accurate: subtracting 29 days from the 24th of December results in the 25th of November.
